    GD50
    Flappy Bird Remake

    Author: Colton Ogden

    A mobile game by Dong Nguyen that went viral in 2013, utilizing a very simple 
    but effective gameplay mechanic of avoiding pipes indefinitely by just tapping 
    the screen, making the player's bird avatar flap its wings and move upwards slightly. 
    A variant of popular games like "Helicopter Game" that floated around the internet
    for years prior. Illustrates some of the most basic procedural generation of game
    levels possible as by having pipes stick out of the ground by varying amounts, acting
    as an infinitely generated obstacle course for the player.
